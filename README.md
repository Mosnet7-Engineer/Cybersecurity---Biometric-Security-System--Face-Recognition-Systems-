# Cybersecurity - Biometric Security System (Face Recognition Systems)

 To gain an analysis of face recognition systems using texture-based feature extraction and matching.

 - Provided with a face dataset (folder: ‘./Face Recognition/Dataset/Faces/’) that contains face images from 200 users/subjects. Each subject has 3 face image samples.

 - Simple detection of	faces	in	all	image	samples	of	each	user will be stored in the local path folder for identifying genuine user's face image purpose, which is the same as where the images will be stored in the database after analyzing in the real world. (Run/execute code file: [Folder: MathCode].
